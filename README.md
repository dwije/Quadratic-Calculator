# quadratic-calculator
A quadratic calculator coded using Java

This calculator has a GUI built using Java Swing components.
The program is composed of one window which opens when run, containing three text boxes for user input and a "Calculate" button.
The inputs are the values required for the quadratic calculation.
Checks are done on the given input to ensure it is valid.
Invalid input (e.g. letters) result in an error message which is displayed in the main window.
If the input is valid, the calculation is done, and the results are displayed on the window.
